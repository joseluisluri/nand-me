## Introduction

Nand is a repository syncronized with internet communities in order to collect precised and acurrated information about ROM videogames. Our goal is contribute to preserve full dumps ensure that future generations aren't provided of our video game history.

This mirror works storing data redundantly on multiple disks to protect information in the case of drive failure. We don't provide download links to copyrighted material or information where to find them.
